 <h1>My life</h1>
<p>I do not want to reveal my name, area where I live in the UK and Bulgaria and do not want to be known. I jsut want to share my day feelings and want I think of people anonymously.
</p>
<p>Life. Some people might have it easier than me, but I am envious of some people. Because I am unpopular people hate me and I eat my lunch in the toilets. I know its disgusting but I am too ashamed of what people think.
 </p>
 
 <p>Please do not judge me.</br>
 I know I am a terrible person.
